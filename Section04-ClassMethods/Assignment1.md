# Problem Statements 
1. For the Course class, add the following: 
    * A private field “subjects” of type List<CourseSubject> to store the list of subjects for the course. 
    * Expose a public property Subjects with only a getter that returns this “subjects” list. 
    * AddSubject method which accepts CourseSubject as a parameter which returns none. It should add the subject to the subjects list. 
    * RemoveSubject method which accepts CourseSubject as a parameter which returns none. It should remove the course subject from the subjects list.
    
2. For the Course class, add an overloaded AddSubject() method that accepts a list of CourseSubjects and adds them to the “subjects” collection.
