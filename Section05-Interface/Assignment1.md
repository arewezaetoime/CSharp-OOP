# Problem Statements 
For the Student class, do the following: 
1. Make it implement the IStudent interface. 

2. Move FirstName and LastName fields to the IStudent interface as properties with a getter and a setter. 

3. Implicitly implement FirstName and LastName properties in the Student class. 

4. Provide default implementation for the GetFullName method in the IStudent interface that returns FirstName and LastName together. Once done, delete the existing implementation for that method from the Student class. 

5. Create a new instance of IStudent in CMS.Application project, assign values for FirstName and LastName, followed by printing the result of GetFullName to the console. 

6. Create a static method WhoAmI() in the IStudent interface that returns “Student” as the value. Access this static method from the console application and print the result.
